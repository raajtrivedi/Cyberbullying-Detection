# 🛡️ Cyberbullying Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a web-based machine learning application that predicts whether a tweet is a form of cyberbullying and categorizes it into specific types like religion, age, gender, etc. It uses a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model along with a TF-IDF vectorizer, and provides an interactive user interface built using **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that can:
- Detect cyberbullying in tweets.
- Classify the type of cyberbullying.
- Allow real-time tweet analysis using a simple web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Predicts if a tweet contains cyberbullying.
- 🧠 Classifies tweets into six categories:
  - Religion-based Cyberbullying
  - Age-based Cyberbullying
  - Ethnicity-based Cyberbullying
  - Gender-based Cyberbullying
  - Other Cyberbullying
  - Not Cyberbullying
- 💻 Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.
- 📊 Includes exploratory data analysis and model building.
